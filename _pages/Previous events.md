               <b>Abstract</b>: In this talk, I will share some of my recent works on bringing zk to real-world usecases. As the main part of the talk, I will discuss how zkLogin has simplified users' onboarding process by using identity tokens from platforms like Google or Facebook to authenticate transactions. Instead of managing new secrets, users can sign in with their existing accounts, and zero-knowledge proofs ensure that the link between a user’s off-chain and on-chain identity stays hidden. Since its launch on the Sui blockchain, zkLogin has processed over 7 million zkLogin-signed transactions, containing around 2.5 million unique Zero-Knowledge Proofs (as of March 17, 2025), making it one of the most widely used zkApp. Additionally I will cover some extra use-cases like targeted Airdrops.

               <b>Abstract</b>: Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a primitive that allows a querier to learn whether there is an intersection between a query set and another set held by a server. This is a privacy-preserving protocol because the querier does not learn anything about the server’s set, and the server does not learn anything about the querier’s set either. FHE-based protocols have advantages such as post-quantum security and asynchrony, but they have the downside of low scalability. The scalability bottleneck lies in the multiplicative nature of the homomorphic circuit evaluated during the PSI protocol. We present an addition-based variant of PSI that overcomes this scalability limit such that the PSI can be run against hundreds of thousands of servers.
